## Project Overview
This project is a conceptual Finance Dashboard created in Power BI designed to help users manage personal finances. It visualizes key metrics to track net worth, income, savings, and expenses, facilitating informed financial decision-making.

## Requirements and KPIs
Based on hypothetical stakeholder needs, the dashboard aims to provide:

- Insight into how expenses and savings fluctuate over time.
- Actionable data to help meet financial goals.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include:

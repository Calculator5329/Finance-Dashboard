## Project Overview
This project showcases a Finance Dashboard designed in Power BI to assist users in tracking expenses, analyzing savings, and understanding financial health against set KPIs. The dashboard was created based on a hypothetical scenario where stakeholder needs and business objectives were taken into consideration to simulate a real-world application.

## Requirements and KPIs
The following requirements were identified to guide the development of the finance dashboard:
- **Expense Tracking**: Ability to track monthly expenses across various categories.
- **Savings Analysis**: Evaluate savings progress and compare it to predefined savings goals.
- **Financial Health Indicators**: Display key financial metrics to assess overall financial stability.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include:
- Expense to Income Ratio
- Month-over-Month Savings Growth
- Emergency Fund Sufficiency

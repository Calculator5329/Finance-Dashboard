## Project Overview
This project is a conceptual Finance Dashboard created in Power BI designed to help users manage personal finances. It visualizes key metrics to track income, savings, expenses, and facilitating informed financial decision-making.

## Requirements and KPIs
Based on hypothetical stakeholder needs, the dashboard aims to provide:
- A real-time overview of financial health.
- Insight into how expenses and savings fluctuate over time.
- Actionable data to help meet financial goals.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include:
- Income
- Savings Allocation
- Expense Allocation
- Net Income

## Design Mockup
The initial design started with a PowerPoint mockup outlining the layout and sections of the dashboard:

- **KPIs**: Current financial metrics for a snapshot of financial standing.
- **Timeline Selection**: Filter data by different time periods.
- **Expense and Savings %**: Showcase expense and savings % of income over time.
- **Expense Breakdown**: Visual representation of spending by category.
- **Savings Breakdown**: Overview of savings distribution.
- **Detailed Statement**: A comprehensive financial statement.
